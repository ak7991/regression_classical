# REGRESSION USING CLASSICAL MODELS

> A ready to use pipeline to train models on custom datasets
> Use this as a boilerplate to build training and benchmarking pipelines
> Includes: 
  - Linear, Polynomial and Ridge Regression
  - Support Vector Regression
  - (Gradient Boosted) Decision Trees
  - KNN Regressor
> Boilerplate contains code for:
  - EDA and visualization
  - model training and optimization 
  - benchmarking
